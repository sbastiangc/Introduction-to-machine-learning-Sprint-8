*English version will be posted soon*

# Project Description:

Mobile company Megaline found out that its customers are using legacy plans. They want to develop a model that can analyze customer behavior and recommend one of Megaline's new plans: Smart or Ultra. You have access to data of subscribers who have already switched to new plans. For this classification task, **you must create a model that choose the right plan.** Develop a model as accurate as possible. In this project, the accuracy threshold is 0.75. Use the dataset to check for accuracy.

# Data:

сalls — total calls,

minutes — call duration (in minutes),

messages — total messages,

mb_used — internet used (in MB),

is_ultra — user actual Plan (Ultra - 1, Smart - 0).
